# AI Digital Twin Platform for Predictive Rural Development in Bharat

## Overview
This project proposes an AI-powered Digital Twin platform designed to support predictive rural development in India. The platform aims to simulate rural environments using real-time data, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics to improve agriculture, water management, employment planning, and disaster preparedness.

The solution focuses on enabling proactive decision-making for farmers, policymakers, NGOs, and researchers through data-driven insights.
